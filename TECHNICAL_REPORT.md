# Mallard Current Technical Report

**Implementation date:** 2026-07-20
**Application version:** 0.1.0
**Scope:** the active implementation only. This report does not describe
superseded formats, migrations, or compatibility behavior.

## 1. Current version contracts

| Contract | Current version |
| --- | ---: |
| Desktop application | 0.1.0 |
| Machine-local sync configuration | Schema 3 |
| Portable bundle head and manifest | Schema 4 |
| Portable storage layout | Version 1 |
| Machine project/profile catalog | Schema 1 |
| Bundle recipe | Schema 1 |
| Per-link project-content preferences | Schema 1 |
| Restore and dependency plans | Schema 1 |
| Setup drafts and transactions | Schema 1 |
| Activity entries and policy | Schema 1 |

The implementation requires these exact contracts and fails closed on an
unsupported version. Local schema 3 and remote schema 4 version different
documents: schema 3 stores machine configuration; schema 4 defines the
portable bundle exchanged through storage.

The application stack is Tauri 2 with a Rust 2021 backend and a React 19,
TypeScript 5.8, and Vite 7 frontend. Rust performs all filesystem, validation,
hashing, persistence, and storage operations. React owns the review state and
submits typed requests through Tauri commands.

## 2. System architecture

```text

  |-- bundle engine: publish, fetch, plan, apply
  `-- object store
       |-- local folder
       `-- S3-compatible storage / R2
```

The main implementation boundaries are:

| `project_sync_v3/commands.rs` | Tauri command boundary and cross-document transactions. |
| `project_sync_v3/persistence.rs` | Bounded, atomic machine-local JSON persistence. |
| `project_sync_v3/s3_store.rs` | S3/R2 transport with conditional writes and bounded pagination. |
| `activity_log.rs` | Sanitized local JSONL activity history and retention. |

## 3. Core domain model

A project is represented by four related records:

1. `LocalProjectRegistration` owns the local project ID, portable bundle ID,
   display name, default recipe, per-storage reviewed bases, and revision.
2. `ProjectBinding` maps that project to one canonical checkout and selected
   machine-local Codex/Claude profile IDs. It also has a replica ID and
   revision.
3. `ProjectStorageLink` connects the project to one storage. It owns the
   destination-specific recipe and project-content preferences.
4. `BundleManifest` is the portable full snapshot published for that link. It
   contains no binding or provider-home paths.

One project can link to multiple storages. Each link has an independent
selection recipe and exclusion set. A decision made for storage A does not
change storage B.

Every portable resource has a `ResourceDescriptor` with a stable ID, kind,
scope, display name, portable provenance, apply policy, codec version, and
bounded metadata. Current resource kinds include provider conversations,
project setup files, memory, agents, commands, rules, skills, plugins, hooks,
MCP definitions, settings, and ordinary project-content files/directories.

## 4. Machine-local metadata

Machine state is stored directly under `~/.mallard`:

```text
~/.mallard/
|-- sync_config.json
|-- machine_projects.json
|-- materializations.json
|-- dependency_applications.json
|-- chat_history_cache.json
|-- project_drafts/<draft-id>.json
|-- setup_transactions/<draft-id>.json
|-- restore_plans/<plan-id>.json
|-- dependency_plans/<plan-id>.json
|-- backups/<plan-id>/...
`-- logs/
```

`sync_config.json` contains schema-3 storage definitions, including S3
credentials, project registrations, project/storage links, recipes,
project-content exclusions, and reviewed remote bases. A `RecipeBase` pins the
generation, commit ID, manifest SHA-256, recipe revision, binding revision,
and last Push/Pull timestamps reviewed on this replica.

`machine_projects.json` contains the provider profile catalog and checkout
bindings. Exact and canonical project/profile paths stay here. Resolved
`CODEX_HOME` and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` values are runtime fields and are not
serialized into portable bundles.

Restore and dependency plans are immutable approval documents. Restore plans
contain resolved absolute targets, source digests, expected target digests or
modes, a binding revision, a remote generation/commit/hash pin, and a 24-hour
expiry. Materialization and dependency-application records contain the
resulting receipts. Backups are stored per restore plan.

Persistence uses bounded reads, schema validation, no-symlink path checks,
revision checks, a process mutex, synced temporary files, and atomic
replacement. On Unix, private metadata paths are permission-restricted. The
process mutex prevents lost updates inside one running app; it is not a
general cross-process database lock.

Project-content preferences have this current shape:

```ts
interface ProjectContentPreferences {
  schema_version: 1;
  revision: number;
  excluded_resource_ids: string[];
}
```

They are stored on the project/storage link and never uploaded. They record
exact entries intentionally left unchecked after a successful Push so later
scans do not select them again automatically.

## 5. Portable storage and schema-4 metadata

Local-folder and S3/R2 storage share one key layout:

```text
.mallard/
|-- .storage.lock                       # local-folder storage only
|-- _storage.json
`-- v1/repositories/<bundle-id>/
    |-- _tag.json
    |-- _head.json
    |-- _manifests/<generation>-<commit-id>.json
    |-- _commits/<generation>-<commit-id>.json
    `-- _uploads/<upload-id>/files/<logical-path>
```

`_storage.json` identifies the root as
`{"format":"mallard-storage","layout_version":1}`. `_head.json` is the
only authoritative mutable bundle pointer. It stores schema version 4, bundle
identity, generation, commit ID, manifest key, manifest SHA-256, and update
time.

Each immutable schema-4 manifest is a complete live snapshot containing:

- portable bundle identity and optional repository fingerprint;
- the destination recipe;
- capture application/tool/codec versions;
- the selected resource descriptors;
- file entries keyed by validated logical path;
- directory entries keyed by validated logical path; and
- typed resource, file, project-file, and project-directory tombstones.

A file entry stores its owner resource ID, SHA-256, byte size, source mtime,
safe mode, and immutable object key. A directory entry stores its resource ID,
safe mode, and source mtime and owns no byte object. A commit record points to
the manifest, links the previous commit ID, and records file delta counts.
`_tag.json` is a derived listing hint; failure to refresh it after a successful
head CAS does not invalidate the generation.

Remote metadata can contain selected conversations and user-authored project
content. It does not contain checkout paths, provider-home paths, local
profile/link/replica IDs, S3 credentials, local exclusions, restore plans,
receipts, backups, or trust decisions. Scanner-only metadata keys beginning
with `_local_` are removed before descriptors enter the manifest.

## 6. Setup and ordinary resource discovery

Project setup is resumable. A setup draft holds selected paths, profile and
storage choices, preallocated IDs, selected resource IDs, and a discovery
signature, but never discovered file bytes. Finalization first writes a
deterministic setup transaction and then reconciles profiles, storage,
registration, links, and binding, making retries idempotent.

Normal discovery inventories the provider-owned resources for the selected
checkout and profiles. It does not scan arbitrary project content. Provider
adapters map source files to portable namespaces such as `project/...` and
`state/codex/...`, assign apply policies, filter credentials, and convert
machine-specific state into portable definitions where supported.

Remote matching uses the portable bundle ID and, when available, a SHA-256
repository fingerprint derived from Git origin data. The checkout binding
remains machine-local.

## 7. Optional non-Git project-file sync

### 7.1 Eligibility

Ordinary project files are eligible only when the canonical project root is
not inside a Git work tree. The backend runs `git -C <root> rev-parse
--show-toplevel` and returns `eligible`, `git_managed`, or `unknown`.

The backend is authoritative. It checks eligibility during scan, immediately
before reviewed Push capture, while building the Pull plan, and again before
applying any approved project-content action. If Git is initialized after a
scan, Push fails before publication. If stored project content exists for a
binding that is now Git-managed, the UI shows a locked Project files step so
the remote actions are visible but cannot be selected.

### 7.2 Scan behavior

The review order is:

```text
Git & sessions -> Skills -> Plugins -> Project files -> Review
```

The Project files step is the opt-in. Opening Push does not scan the ordinary
tree. `inspect_project_files` performs the explicit scan and returns a typed
inventory, eligibility result, comparison state, warning data, preference
revision, and review token. Scanning does not publish or modify saved config.

The scanner:

- walks without following links and sorts entries deterministically;
- tracks every real file and directory as an independent resource;
- includes empty directories;
- excludes nested registered projects and paths owned by existing provider
  adapters;
- excludes Mallard metadata, every configured local storage, and mapped
  provider homes;
- honors `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, and `.mallardignore`;
- hard-excludes VCS directories, common build/cache output, and known
  credential filenames;
- blocks symlinks, Unix hard links, special files, private-key material,
  unsafe paths, oversized files, and excessive depth; and
- flags executable or credential-shaped opaque content for explicit review.

Secret detection is deliberately best-effort. A clean scan is not a guarantee
that content contains no secret.

### 7.3 Identity, paths, and metadata

The normalized project-relative path is the stable identity input:

```text
file ID      project:content-file:<sha256("file\0" + relative-path)>
directory ID project:content-dir:<sha256("dir\0" + relative-path)>
logical path project/<relative-path>
```

The bound project root itself is not a resource. For
`docs/specs/a.md`, `docs`, `docs/specs`, and `docs/specs/a.md` are three
separate resources. Selecting the file requires both directory resources.
Directory selection is a bulk convenience over currently discovered entries;
it is not a wildcard for future children.

The comparison digest includes entry type, relative path, file-content hash
when applicable, and safe mode. Source mtime is retained for display and
best-effort restoration but is not part of this comparison digest. Ownership,
set-id bits, ACLs, xattrs, creation time, and platform-specific flags are not
portable. Modes are restricted to `0o777`.

### 7.4 Three-view comparison and selection

The Push inventory compares:

- `local`: the explicit scan result;
- `storage`: the current schema-4 head manifest; and
- `base`: the exact generation last reviewed by this binding/link.

Entries are classified as `synced`, `local_only`, `local_ahead`,
`storage_only`, `storage_ahead`, `diverged`, `missing`, `blocked`, or
`unknown`. An unavailable historical base forces relevant entries to
`unknown` instead of guessing.

After Scan, a newly discovered eligible entry is selected in the pending
review unless its stable ID is in the link's exclusion set. Existing recipe
entries remain selected. Selected descendants force their ancestor directory
entries to remain selected. This state is still transient until Push
succeeds.

The review token binds the local project and replica IDs, binding revision,
eligibility, preference revision, remote generation/commit/manifest hash, and
every reviewed entry state/digest/warning. Push rescans and recomputes it.
Changed bytes, modes, warnings, binding, preferences, or remote head require a
fresh review. Warning acknowledgements are separately bound to the resource,
review digest, and warning code.

## 8. Push protocol and metadata updates

Push executes in this order:

1. Load and validate the registration, storage link, binding, provider
   profiles, current revisions, and Codex conversation-path readiness.
2. Discover normal project/provider resources.
3. Preserve every stored project-content recipe entry unless the request has
   an explicit removal ID.
4. If generic content changes, require a current scan token, recheck
   eligibility, verify warnings, reject blocked/disappeared new resources,
   and insert required directory ancestors.
5. Capture exactly the final recipe. Selected content is revalidated,
   re-read, size-bounded, and hashed.
6. Compare the current remote head with the local `RecipeBase`. A missing,
   unknown, stale, or binding-mismatched base blocks publication.
7. Upload selected file objects, then the immutable manifest and commit.
8. Compare-and-swap `_head.json` from the reviewed ETag to the new generation.
9. Best-effort refresh `_tag.json`.
10. Guardedly update machine-local metadata.

Publication writes immutable objects before the mutable head. A failed CAS can
leave unreachable upload/manifest/commit objects, but readers cannot observe a
partial generation. Local-folder storage serializes publication with
`.mallard/.storage.lock`. S3/R2 uses `If-None-Match` or `If-Match`; an
ambiguous response is resolved by rereading the head and comparing bytes.

### Successful Push: remote update

The remote gains a new generation containing the full selected resource set,
file objects, directory entries, and any typed tombstones. Removing a selected
resource from the recipe is not enough for ordinary project content: the
command preserves stored entries unless its resource ID is explicitly listed
for removal.

### Successful Push: local update

After head publication, one guarded config mutation:

- saves the destination recipe on the project/storage link;
- updates the link's exact exclusion set and increments its preference
  revision only if those preferences changed;
- writes the new `RecipeBase` generation, commit, manifest hash, recipe
  revision, binding revision, and Push timestamp; and
- increments the project/config revisions.

Scan, cancel, capture failure, upload failure, and head-CAS conflict do not
change the saved recipe or exclusions. There is one unavoidable distributed
boundary: if the remote head succeeds and the later guarded local mutation
detects a local revision race, the remote generation remains valid while the
command reports that local state must be refreshed.

## 9. Explicit removal and tombstones

Local absence is not deletion intent. If Machine A deletes
`docs/file_a`, Scan reports the path as missing, but Push keeps the stored
entry unless A chooses **Remove from storage** for that exact resource.

An approved storage removal produces:

- a `project_content_file` tombstone with its logical path and last byte
  SHA-256; or
- a `project_content_directory` tombstone with its exact logical path.

Removing a directory does not imply recursive removal. Stored descendants
must each be removed, and the backend rejects a parent-directory removal while
stored descendants remain selected. A rename is represented as removal of the
old exact resource plus addition of the new exact resource.

## 10. Pull planning, apply, and metadata updates

Pull is split into immutable review and mutation phases.

### 10.1 Fetch and plan

Fetch validates the storage marker, head, manifest schema, bundle identity,
manifest SHA-256, logical paths, resource ownership, case-folded path
collisions, directory ancestry, tombstones, object sizes, and every file
SHA-256. The restore planner maps portable logical paths to the current
binding and emits typed actions.

Project content uses four explicit action kinds:

- `write_project_file`;
- `ensure_project_directory`;
- `delete_project_file`; and
- `delete_project_directory`.

Every project-content action requires approval and starts unchecked in the
UI. Selecting a nested file also selects its planned ancestor directories.
Unchecked actions mean **Keep local / skip this Pull** and do not block
approved conversations, skills, plugins, or setup work.

The plan pins the storage, bundle, replica, generation, commit, manifest hash,
binding revision, targets, expected target digests/modes, and expiry. Native
plugin/installer work is placed in a separate dependency plan with identical
snapshot and binding pins.

### 10.2 Apply preflight

Before mutation, Apply rejects unknown/duplicate action IDs, expired or
already-recorded plans, changed bindings, changed remote heads, changed
fetched bytes, path escapes, link traversal, changed target hashes/modes, and
newly Git-managed project roots when a project-content action was approved.

Apply uses this filesystem order:

1. Prepare approved directories shallowest-first with a temporary
   owner-writable mode.
2. Apply approved file writes using synced temporary files and atomic rename;
   back up an existing target first.
3. Apply approved file deletions deepest-first after digest/mode revalidation
   and a verified immutable backup.
4. Apply approved directory deletions deepest-first, but only when each exact
   target is a real empty directory.
5. Finalize prepared directory modes and best-effort mtimes deepest-first.

Thus `project/docs/specs/a.md` maps to
`<canonical-project-root>/docs/specs/a.md`; Pull creates `docs` and
`docs/specs` before writing `a.md`. It never creates an unrelated `/spec`
directory.

If Machine B changed a file covered by a deletion tombstone, its digest no
longer matches and deletion fails without removing B's bytes. If B has an
untracked `docs/local.md`, approved tracked child files may be deleted, but
`docs` remains because recursive deletion is forbidden. A failed directory
removal is recorded and a retry requires a refreshed plan.

### 10.3 Successful Pull: local and remote metadata

Pull never changes remote storage. Locally, it records one materialization
with applied, skipped, failed, and blocked receipts plus any backup paths. If
the file phase is complete, including explicit keep-local decisions recorded
as skipped actions, it updates the link recipe to the pulled manifest recipe
and advances the `RecipeBase`. Project-content exclusion preferences are not
rewritten by Pull.

Dependency actions are applied and recorded separately, followed by readiness
verification. Supporting dependency/readiness failures do not hide an already
valid restore plan from the user.

## 11. Integrity, concurrency, and path safety

All IDs and cloud namespace components use bounded validated grammars. Bundle
IDs are opaque lowercase 128-bit hex values. Logical and object paths must be
relative, normalized, and free of empty, dot, parent, backslash, or unsafe
platform components. Manifests reject file/directory type collisions and
case-insensitive path collisions.

SHA-256 binds:

- each uploaded file object to its manifest entry;
- the serialized manifest to `_head.json` and the commit record;
- reviewed local/storage/base content comparisons; and
- warning acknowledgement and Push review tokens.

Restore target construction starts at the canonical bound root, performs a
safe lexical join, resolves prospective canonical paths, and inspects every
existing ancestor without following symlinks. Writes never use a remote
absolute path.

Head CAS provides single-winner publication. A pusher must hold the exact
reviewed `RecipeBase`, and a restore plan must still match the current head.
The immutable commit chain retains published history, while stale writers fail
and must fetch/review again.

A local storage directory must not overlap `~/.mallard`, a project checkout,
a provider profile, or another configured local storage. Filesystem lock files
protect writers that see the same local filesystem; sync services such as
iCloud or Dropbox do not provide a reliable distributed lock for simultaneous
multi-machine Push.

## 12. Current limits

| Limit | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Discovered resources | 20,000 |
| Generic project-content depth | 32 components |
| Captured file size | 16 MiB |
| Aggregate selected capture | 512 MiB |
| Manifest resources | 20,000 |
| Manifest files/directories/tombstones | 100,000 each |
| Restore actions | 100,000 |
| Logical path length | 1,024 bytes |
| Object read/write ceiling | 512 MiB |
| Ignore rules | 8,192 |
| Restore-plan lifetime | 24 hours |
| Project-file rows rendered at once | 500 |

The UI uses path search and collapsed directories for inventories larger than
the render window. Backend validation remains authoritative for the full set.

## 13. Current automated coverage

The project-content backend tests cover stable IDs, nested and empty
directories, ignore/exclusion behavior, credential blocking, symlink and hard
link rejection, file-size/depth limits, the 20,000-resource stress boundary,
review-token/warning freshness, a Git-after-scan race, a two-machine nested
round trip, explicit typed tombstones, divergent deletion blocking, verified
backups, and non-recursive directory deletion with an untracked child.

Frontend integration tests cover conditional tab visibility and order,
explicit scan opt-in, new-entry default selection, required ancestor
directories, Pull's default keep-local behavior, empty approved-action
submission, and locked remote project content on a Git binding.

Use the current verification commands:

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:frontend-integration
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib
```

Verification on 2026-07-20 completed successfully: the production frontend
build and Rust check passed, all 56 frontend integration tests passed, and all
415 Rust library tests passed. Vite reported only its advisory large-chunk
warning for the current frontend bundle.

Project-content end-to-end command coverage currently uses local-folder
storage. The S3 adapter and bundle protocol have automated transport coverage,
but a live R2/S3 project-content smoke test remains an external release check.

## 14. Current behavioral boundaries

- Ordinary project-file sync is intentionally unavailable inside any Git work
  tree; it is not tied specifically to GitHub hosting.
- Project content is exact-entry sync, not a future-child folder rule.
- Scans are explicit; no background watcher adds files to a recipe.
- Pull project-content actions are never selected automatically.
- Directory deletion is exact and empty-only; recursive deletion is not
  implemented by design.
- Secret scanning cannot certify arbitrary user content as safe.
- Portable filesystem metadata is limited to file bytes, safe POSIX mode, and
  best-effort source mtime.
- A Push publishes a new immutable snapshot from the selected recipe; storage
  history is bundle versioning, not source control.
