## Backend contracts

`project_sync_v3::chat_history` contains scanning, parsing, Git discovery, temporal mapping, details, caching, and launch construction. Commands run blocking filesystem/process work off the async Tauri thread and are registered in both command handler lists.

```rust
get_project_chat_history(
    repository,
    local_project_id,
    branch,
    before_time,
    window_days,
    force_revalidate,
) -> ProjectChatHistory

get_project_chat_thread_details(
    repository,
    local_project_id,
    thread_id,
    cursor,
    limit,
) -> CodexThreadDetailsPage
```

The history response contains `codex_home`, window bounds, `next_before`, storage activity, thread summaries, optional Git history, uncommitted references, and technical warnings. The command emits warnings to Sync Log. Display name, alias, and directory presentation remain in existing project/binding DTOs.

`CodexThreadSummary` carries start/end/active state, branch and recorded SHA context, user rounds, agent messages, tool calls, maximum cumulative tokens, `metrics_complete`, and `commit_occurrence_count`. `CommitThreadReference` carries only a thread ID. `ThreadMatchKind` and confidence fields are removed.

## Full-stream parser and cache

The rollout parser uses a bounded `BufReader` line reader and never retains the whole session. There is no 256-record, 16 MiB rollout, or 10,000-session stop. Ordinary records retain only metadata and counters; oversized records are selectively projected for the same fields. A malformed record is skipped and marks metrics partial, while later records are still read.

### Oversized-record recovery

The existing 1 MiB bounded reader remains the fast path. Before each read, the parser records the JSONL record's file offset. If the bounded reader reports an oversized record, the parser seeks back to that offset and gives a newline-limited view of the record to `serde_json` for streaming deserialization. After success or failure, it advances to the next record boundary so one bad record cannot stop the session.

The streaming projection retains only the fields used by existing behavior: top-level and payload timestamps, session ID, working directory, Git branch/SHA metadata, payload type and role, tool-call and user/agent counters, cumulative token totals, and visible user/assistant text from `message`, `text`, `input_text`, and `output_text`. Large or irrelevant values use `serde::de::IgnoredAny`, allowing image URLs/base64, compaction snapshots, reasoning, tool arguments/results, and unknown fields to be scanned without being retained. The projection is converted into the same minimal record shape consumed by the current summary and detail parsers so normal and oversized records keep identical filtering rules.

Filtered `event_msg.user_message` remains the authoritative source for User previews; user-role `response_item` content is not exposed because it can include injected context. Codex previews continue to accept visible `event_msg.agent_message` and assistant `response_item.message` text and deduplicate paired copies. Successfully projected records, including irrelevant compaction and tool-output records, do not emit oversized-line warnings. A malformed oversized record produces at most one warning per rollout scan, marks metrics partial, and does not prevent later records from loading.

The cache schema is incremented so previously cached partial scans are discarded and reparsed. No Tauri command signature, Rust response DTO, TypeScript type, pagination rule, preview length, or frontend rendering contract changes as part of this update.

Timestamp priority is:

1. first and last valid timestamped records in the complete rollout;
2. session metadata timestamp;
3. session-index update time only for a partial session;
4. filesystem modification time.

`session_index.jsonl` supplies the preferred title. A malformed non-timestamp record never lets the index replace otherwise valid rollout endpoints. The local cache is `~/.mallard/chat_history_cache.json`; entries include canonical profile/path identity, file size, nanosecond mtime, and parsed metadata/metrics only. It is schema-versioned, size/entry bounded, symlink-safe, atomically replaced with mode `0600`, and stored below a mode-`0700` metadata root. Deleted rollout entries are pruned. Changed files miss the key and are fully reread. The Refresh button sends `force_revalidate=true`, bypasses hits, and rewrites validated entries.

## Mapping and 30-day windows

The scanner first filters sessions by `ended_at` into `[window_start, window_end)`. Git uses enumerated local branches, structured argv, first-parent/date-order logs, and a bounded 10,000-commit correlation rail. Session branch metadata prevents attaching a named session to a different branch.

All inclusive overlaps are attached. With none, the chronologically first commit no more than 24 hours after session end is used once. Otherwise the session is uncommitted. Commit references are sorted by session end descending, then start ascending, then thread ID. Unique session and reference counts are separate.

The response normally exposes commits in the requested 30-day window, plus any boundary commit carrying a selected session reference. Frontend page merging unions commit references by SHA/thread ID, recalculates occurrence counts, and prevents cross-window loss.

## Lazy details

Every detail request validates UUID, registered project, active binding, canonical project/profile paths, and rollout ownership. Duplicate IDs consistently select the complete rollout before the latest partial rollout for both summaries and details. The detail parser streams the winner and returns at most 50 genuine user/assistant previews from the cursor. User previews come only from filtered `event_msg.user_message`; agent previews accept visible `event_msg.agent_message` and assistant `response_item.message`, deduplicating paired copies. Injected tags and non-user roles, reasoning, system/developer messages, tool data, and raw payloads are excluded.

The same filtering and pagination rules apply to text projected from oversized records. Images remain excluded; an image-bearing record contributes only its eligible text and metadata.

The frontend holds message pages once per thread ID and expansion state once per visual occurrence. Thus expanding one occurrence loads shared data without expanding every repeated card. Per-occurrence `aria-controls` IDs and keys use commit SHA plus thread ID.

## Storage timestamps

`RecipeBase` adds backward-compatible optional `last_pull_at` and `last_push_at`. Successful Push publish sets `last_push_at`; only an overall successful Pull apply sets `last_pull_at`, preserving the other timestamp. For older data, the latest complete matching materialization `applied_at` is the Pull fallback.

## Project-scoped launch security

Both actions revalidate ownership immediately before execution and log the exact command first.

- App: first opens `codex://threads/new?path=<encoded-canonical-project-root>`, waits briefly for the bound profile to persist that project selection, then opens `codex://threads/<uuid>` in a second `/usr/bin/open -n -a /Applications/ChatGPT.app --env CODEX_HOME=<bound-home>` command. Existing-thread links do not accept a project path, and combining a folder plus a thread URL in one launch can lose the folder event when that profile is already running.
- Terminal: resolves an absolute Codex CLI, then opens Terminal with a shell-quoted `CODEX_HOME=<bound-home> <codex> resume <uuid> -C <canonical-project-root>` command.

UUIDs are strict, paths come from revalidated bindings, and user branch/cursor values never enter a shell. Missing app/CLI and OS launch failures return specific action errors.

## Frontend structure

`ProjectChatHistoryPage` owns branch/window loading, stale-request protection, merged pages, launch state, and lazy detail caches. `ProjectChatHistoryContent` is a pure renderer used by integration tests. Git renders Uncommitted Changes then newest-first commits; non-Git renders a flat newest-activity-first Codex thread list. Browser `content-visibility`/intrinsic sizing limits layout and paint work for rows outside the viewport when the rendered history exceeds 100 rows.

`list_project_repository_kinds` probes each active canonical binding with structured `git -C … rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`. `ProjectSyncV3` joins the returned machine-local map into `LocalProjectSummary`, allowing the sidebar to render a static `Git Based`/`Non-Git Based` chip without scanning Codex history or persisting repository type in synchronized configuration. Unbound projects omit the indicator rather than being mislabeled.
