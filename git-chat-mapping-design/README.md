# Project Activity and Codex Session History

## Implemented behavior

A completed project row is the single navigation target for project activity. The separate Git action has been removed. Each bound completed row now has a compact, non-interactive `Git Based` or `Non-Git Based` indicator; it communicates repository type but is not another navigation target. Setup drafts remain non-project rows and cannot call history APIs. Project and Storage Settings stay dedicated pages; closing them returns to the selected project activity page. A successful Pull increments the existing refresh epoch so restored sessions are rescanned.

The title uses `projectLabel(project)`: a machine-local alias is primary and the shared repository name is secondary. The compact header shows the canonical project directory, bound Codex configuration path, and per-storage last Pull/Push timestamps. Git projects add Branch and Refresh controls; non-Git projects omit them.

```text
Project Name          Local alias or repository name
Directory             /canonical/local/path
Codex configuration   /project/profile/.codex                  [Settings]

Storage sync
  Storage 1           Last Pull …                 Last Push …

The `Uncommitted Changes` label means no overlapping commit and no qualifying follow-up commit on the recorded branch. It does not describe current `git status`.

## Session and mapping semantics

Each rollout JSONL file is one Codex session. Mallard streams the complete file and derives authoritative start/end dates from its first and last timestamped records. It counts genuine `user_message` rounds, visible `agent_message` events, tool calls, and the maximum reported cumulative token total. Malformed or individually oversized lines are skipped without stopping the file; the session becomes partial and diagnostics go to Sync Log.

For a selected first-parent branch:

1. A session is attached to every commit timestamp inclusively inside its start/end range.
2. With no overlap, it is attached once to the first commit within 24 hours after its end.
3. Otherwise it appears under `Uncommitted Changes`.

Recorded SHA remains visible session context but is not an attachment rule. One session spanning three commits is one unique session and three commit occurrences. It intentionally renders under all three commits; all occurrences share metrics, launch target, and a frontend detail cache keyed by thread ID.

The initial response is the latest exclusive 30-day window. `Load previous 30 days` appends the next complete `[before − 30 days, before)` window. Boundary commits carrying a mapped session are returned as needed and merged by SHA/thread ID so cross-window sessions remain visible at every occurrence.

## Chat details and privacy

`Show chat details` lazily loads genuine User and Codex message previews, 50 at a time, chronologically. Each preview is normalized and capped at 240 characters. System/developer content, injected context, reasoning, and raw tool payloads are excluded. Full chat text and derived metadata stay local and never enter bundle manifests. The on-disk cache under `~/.mallard/chat_history_cache.json` contains only parsed metadata/metrics, keyed by profile, rollout path, size, and modification time.

## Main-branch compatibility

The work preserves the main changes already merged through `2edc284`, including the relevant `826d890`, `60e0ea5`, and `d4d794a` work: global `~/.mallard` persistence, resumable setup, optimistic revisions, resizable sidebar, local aliases, and dedicated settings layouts. The landed `Git Info` fallback is replaced in place; no parallel `links | chat-history` state is introduced.

## Design decisions made autonomously

- Kept the existing dense desktop theme tokens and outline icons; added no gradients, badges, fonts, palettes, or icon dependencies.
- Used a neutral metric grid and explicit Started/Ended values instead of prompt extracts or mapping-confidence labels.
- Kept repeated cards visually identical and explained repetition with subdued occurrence text.
- Used semantic disclosure buttons, visible focus rings, per-occurrence DOM IDs, and browser viewport containment for long lists.
- Put scan diagnostics and exact launch commands in Sync Log instead of a page-wide technical warning.
- Superdesign CLI 0.6.0 was reachable on 2026-07-19, but `auth status --json` returned `authenticated: false`; no unapproved substitute export was placed in `assets/`.
